# Elegance of Phase Space

Please find attached the 'Report' file containing the work. The Python code used to plot phase diagram of the harmonic oscillator can be found in the appendix.

Abstract: I was extremely intrigued by phase space trajectories when I encountered them. Having seen a few phase space diagrams in the lecture notes, I decided to code and plot phase space trajectories of some simple systems myself. In this 
very brief self-study, I recap the basics of Hamiltonian dynamics and then plot phase space portraits of simple, 1 degree of freedom, autonomous systems using the lecture notes as my primary resource. I discuss how phase diagrams can be such a 
powerful tool to study the dynamics of a system.
